# 5-DOF-Robot-Arm

Development of a 5-DOF robot arm capable of performing a pick-and-place task.

In our project, we utilized a pre-designed robot arm to perform various computations essential in robotics. This included deriving the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) tables, implementing forward and inverse kinematics, and
determining the manipulator Jacobian. Utilizing these calculations, we successfully executed a pick-and-place task, showcasing the practical application and capabilities of the robot arm.
